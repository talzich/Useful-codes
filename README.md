# Useful Codes

In November 2021 I attended a lecture by Dr. Roi Yozevitch. He told us a story about a CS professor he met that kept every useful piece of code he wrote stored and organized. Over the years, the professor noticed he wrote less and less new code, and depended mainly on the code he previously stored.  

As a result, this repo was born.
